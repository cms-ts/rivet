RunInfo:
   Run MC generators with Z decaying leptonically into both electrons and muons at 7 TeV CoM energy. 
   Order of 5 million unweighted events can give a reasonable global comparison, but precision in the 
   high jet multiplicity region/high jet pt may require substantially larger samples or statistical 
   enhancement of high jet multiplicities.
Beams: [p+, p+]
Energies: [7000]
PtCuts: first two leading electrons or muons with pt > 20 GeV and |eta| < 2.4
        Dilepton invariant mass in the [71,111] GeV range
        Jets pt > 30 GeV and |eta| < 2.4
Description:
   'Measurements of differential cross sections are presented for 
   the production of a Z boson and at least one hadronic jet in 
   proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=\unit{7}{\TeV}$, recorded by 
   the CMS detector, using a data sample corresponding to an integrated 
   luminosity of $\unit{4.9} fb^{âˆ’1}$. The jet multiplicity distribution 
   is measured for up to six jets. The differential cross sections are 
   measured as a function of jet transverse momentum and pseudorapidity 
   for the four highest transverse momentum jets. The distribution of 
   the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta is also measured as a function 
   of the jet multiplicity. The measurements are compared with theoretical 
   predictions at leading and next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD.'
