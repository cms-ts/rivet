  CERN-LHC.  Measurements of the associated production of a Z boson with at least one jet originating from a b quark in proton-proton collisions at s= 8 TeV are presented. Differential cross sections are measured with data collected by the CMS experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.8 fb**1. Z bosons are reconstructed through their decays to electrons and muons. Cross sections are measured as a function of observables characterizing the kinematics of the b jet and the Z boson. Ratios of differential cross sections for the associated production with at least one b jet to the associated production with any jet are also presented. The production of a Z boson with two b jets is investigated, and differential cross sections are measured for the dijet system. Results are compared to theoretical predictions, testing two different flavour schemes for the choice of initial-state partons.

  The fiducial region is defined as:
  - 2e or 2mu
  - ptLepton > 20 GeV
  - |etaLepton| < 2.4
  - mll must be between 71 and 111 GeV
  - at least one jet anti-kt(DR=0.5) with ptJet > 30 GeV and |etaJet| < 2.4
  - DeltaR(l,jet) > 0.5
  - for Z+>=1b (indicated as Z(1b)): at least one selected jet b-tagged; for Z+>=2b (indicated as Z(2b)): at least two selected jets b-tagged
