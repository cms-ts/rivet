RunInfo: 'Run MC generators with Z decaying leptonically into both electrons and muons at 8 TeV CoM energy.
For jet-flavour inclusive samples, order of 20 million unweighted events can give a reasonable global comparison, 
but precision in the high jet multiplicity region/high jet pt may require substantially larger samples or statistical
enhancement of high jet multiplicities.'

Description:
'Measurements of the associated production of a Z boson with at least
one jet originating from a b quark in proton-proton collisions
at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV are presented. Differential cross sections are
measured with data collected by the CMS experiment corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 19.8 $\text{fb}^{-1}$. Z bosons are reconstructed
through their decays to electrons and muons. Cross sections are
measured as a function of observables characterizing the kinematics of
the b jet and the Z boson. Ratios of differential cross
sections for the associated production with at least one b jet
to the associated production with any jet are also presented.  The
production of a Z boson with at least two b jets is investigated,
and differential cross sections are measured for the dijet system.
Results are compared to theoretical predictions, testing two different
flavour schemes for the choice of initial-state partons.'
